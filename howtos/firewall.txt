I want to discontinue the use of AKS firewall to restrict outbound traffic from the cluster.

Another PC pattern is currently under work and will be GA in 1Q2025. 
This pattern is asking us to use Network isolated Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters [Network isolated AKS clusters - Azure Kubernetes Service | Microsoft Learn|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network-isolated]

we will need analyze impact of discontinue firewall across all usecase and all components currently we are using.

please analyze dependencies and issues what you think and any alternative solution?
